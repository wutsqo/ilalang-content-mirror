# the death of a peasant

<pre align="right">

<pre align="center">I</pre>
<pre>
there, before the office of my lord the regent
lies a peasant
because of land
because of land.


there, in the office of the peasant union
the hungry fume
because of blood.


land and blood
turn the wheels of history
from here the flame springs
from here peace everlasting.

he fell
prostrate
a bullet in his head.
his mind went back in torture
yet torture was only for his body
he remembered the days of his youth
his son turned soldier
--- ah, who will give them food ? ---


my wife weeds the ricefield
let the rice rage at the stalk
pity them
pity them
they are our comrades


give me water, I am thirsty
my body weak with hunger.
I came to them
then back to you,
and as the dry land lay white on the skin
we had food together.


and then, all went gloomy,
gloomy
extinguished
and black
as night.
</pre>
<pre align="center">III</pre>
<pre>
they say
that those in power
who murder the people
should quit.
</pre>
<pre align="center">IV</pre>
<pre>
the pregnant paddy withstands
the wind.
the sound of the flute in the dismal hut
impregnates life.


the pregnant paddy dances
on the wind.


just see, the women boldly going naked
their hoes and paddy smashed to smithereens
the prison is their home
and even the baby at their breast knows torture.


they say
that those in power
who rob the people
should quit
before being forced to do so.


if the tractor comes
to destroy our dwellings
we'll bang at every door.
</pre>
