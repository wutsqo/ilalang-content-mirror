# democracy

<pre>
generals, it's we that adorned
your chest with medals
wrested from landlords' and usurers' torturous hands
we now demand of your medals : where's our land 


generals, it's we that adorned
your chest with medals
out of the sweat of a seven-hour that became a ten-hour work-day,
we now demand of yours medals : where's our pay ?


generals, one after another we fell
arms in hand against the Dutch
we now demand of your medals : where's our Irian ?


generals, certainly it's not you
who will give land, wages and Irian
what we want is : let us build one mighty front
and above all, give us freedom to speak.
</pre>
