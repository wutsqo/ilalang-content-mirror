<pre>
this night is a lonely night
wrought up with anxiety of birth
this night is a sacred night
bearing tidings from the party
bidding farewell to yesterday
hailing the day of tomorrow


I kiss this night
which arouses morning in my heart
I kiss you my party
dawn in this day


tidings from the party unfurl the banners
of battles against myself
confront me with this choice
of delight in life
abandoning personal passions
or fading away before death


tidings from the party have shown
the road which ends defeats.
</pre>
