<pre>
bright are the Tjiandjur skies, the fertile soil binds the peasant
sadri, an old peasant, owns a plot of land
his life is harmonious, peaceful, beautiful
blossoming like the seasons


the banana ripens, the oranges, the papayas
littering the branches, flagrant overripe
ask sadri when he will pick them and he replies
when my son comes home from the battle


ah, the sweet fragrance of the fruit moistens the tongue
the orchards flourish on the rich Periangan soil
beloved land, united, defying the splitters
full of beauty, fertility, but what of the heart ?
</pre>

II
</pre>
<pre>
sadri waits with pounding heart
his eyes glued to the southern skies
the flames leap up high
a brutal for force is burning peace


lovely Periangan, burning, reddened by fire
the peasants trapped, scorched on their native earth
comrades, brothers, against this challenge the will is supreme
resistance, revenge in every heart


the crops, the oranges and the papayas
once overripe and weighing down the trees
lie destroyed, overrun by fire
and thousands of lives nipped in the bud.
</pre>
