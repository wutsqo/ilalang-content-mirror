<pre>
life does not depend on some external force
it must be grasped by we who live
it bears fruit that grows from within
ripening slowly but never for a moment still


life is as vast as the raging seas
but it flows not on its own, it must be steered
advancing towards an objective
firmly and accurately aimed


life is a vast flood of water
green and blue, its depth can be gauged
not veiled in mystery but with fineries interwoven
and things that are important for you and me.
</pre>
