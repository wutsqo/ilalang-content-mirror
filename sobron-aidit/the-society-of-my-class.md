<pre>
udin, seventeen times you have been kicked around
eight times you have dragged your bruised body away
forty five times perhaps kicked from pillar to post
when you visit your home in no man's land
you'll be driven away on the morrow to tears and wails
but tears and abuse are of no avail
because there it is still : the bustle of life under the bridge


udin, endure the kicks and the knocks
do not say : where next shall I be thrown.
but contain your vengeance till it hardens as the river stones
till the time comes : victory or death


ah, my country, only part of it feels the touch of the sun's
     golden breath
the other lives in darkness, touched by the wind of death
such are the extremes between the high and low
in a society split into classes since times of yore


the society of my class, long have I dreamed of the sunrays
of a future for udin and for the others
who yearn for friendly love binding equals to each other
ah, how black and soiled it is today
but wait, for the boil will burst, molten fire will burst forth
the time will come when the enemy meets death at the point
<pre align="right">
of the dagger
</pre>
the battles for the people were not in vain
they have fertilised the sturdy seedling planted by lenin


udin, wait, for the boil will burst all of a sudden
the wheel of history will surely turn round
effacing the darkness and the wind of death
and for my class only the golden sunrays.
</pre>
