# my father

<pre>
my father was not among those who returned

my father fell on the field of battle



my heart's torn asunder with sorrow and grief

and the red-and-white flag flutters high in the sky



oh, people of today

do you hear ?

my father is dead, he was slaughtered by bullets

oh, why does such suffering still stalk the earth ?
</pre>
