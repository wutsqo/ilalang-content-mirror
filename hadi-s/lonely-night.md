# lonely night

<pre>
the night is lonely
but my heart is lonelier still
the cold wind yearns for your cabin door
and all of you are lulled to sleep

I come ... 
albeit the dew has merged as one 
albeit the cold has penetrated my bones 
for all of you are my devotion 
I must come though 
you know nothing   

I set my longing to verse 
though it has no meaning 
but I do it for the sake of love and purity of heart   

the night is lonely
but my heart is lonelier still
and tomorrow ...
the day will return on the surge of labour
the harbour will bustle 
the workshops will ring again 
and the radiant morning will dawn. 
</pre>
