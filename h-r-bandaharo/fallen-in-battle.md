# fallen in battle

<pre>
nine hours after the battle


there he lies
rifle at his side
and his breast pierced with bullets


deadly silence all around
broken by his panting breath
he raises up his head
as if in doubt :
there it is
the rustling of wings
is it the angel of death ?


almost weary of waiting
suddenly from far away
he hearts the shout of victory
carried by the wind
to the lonely fighter
freedom !   freedom !

his very being shouts for joy
this cry is his reward.
in the battle for which he staked his life
freedom means victory
and the free man lives in paradise


a new strength surges through him
covered as he is with is blood
he musters all the will in his feeble body
pressing his hands on the soil he defended
he rises slowly
he shouts and clenches his fists
freedom !   freedom !


this was the last sound he uttered
joy in his heart
victory in battle
he stepped forward
and fell.
</pre>
