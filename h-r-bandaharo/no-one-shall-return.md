### no one shall return

<pre>
the masses march towards the day
the mass I represent
the sorrows and sufferings of my times
lie heavy on my shoulders


no one shall return
though death awaits ahead


this road leads on to the break of dawn
and stirring, peaceful chants
our aspirations give birth to love
directly drunk from life


no one shall return
though death awaits ahead.
</pre>
