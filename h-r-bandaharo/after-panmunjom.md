<pre align="right">
for Major Yoon Gil
</pre>
<br/><br/>
<pre>
after panmunjom
everything maimed
except ideology
the imperialists vented their malice
on things and innocent people
everywhere destruction
everything in ruins
corpses of partisans piled up
and no two stones standing
after panmunjom
nothing has been steeled more
than the people



ideology unmaimed
people steeled
that's a giant creator
korea stands gloriously erect
on the red soil.
</pre>
