# the downtrodden shoulder freedom

<pre>
we the downtrodden shoulder freedom
without rank, nameless
we've kept our country from becoming a prison


we possess nothing
but ninety million burning hearts
do not try to keep us still
fear lies buried under barren hills


we possess nothing
but burning hearts that seek no reward
we guard the islands that kiss the beloved sea
we fight for wages and land of freedom


we possess nothing
but burning hearts roughened by suffering
that may turn into lava, fire and thunder
destroying foes, grinding them to dust


we the downtrodden shoulder freedom
without rank, nameless
we've kept our country from becoming a prison
</pre>
