# to people's bandung

<pre> 
wherever they come from, the people are the people
wherever they are, times are with the people
and the wind touches every bossom :
the free heart of africa
the revolutionary heart of asia


those who have come
are lovers, fighters all
children of the sun
sparks of multi-coloured fireworks
and the colour grows at the waist of the mountain
and embraces the faith of bandung


those who are here
are all beloved, are fire all
children of the earth
who with flowers combat death
and the flower grows at the waist of the mountain
and embrace the solidarity of bandung


wherever they come from, the people are the people
wherever they are, times are with the people
and the wind touches the free heart :
the song of revolution
peace in all the world.
</pre>
