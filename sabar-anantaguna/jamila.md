# jamila

<pre>
the world did once inflict a wound
but understanding rose from within


one touch of light in the soldier's breast
and willingly she accepted death
for she herself is the world and holds life in her hand
for she herself is the native land and the fruit of love


another touch came down at dawn
and she defended all her dreams


the world has inflicted a wound
but consciousness was conceived within its womb


one draw of breath in the soldier's breast
and she did profess herself
slowly but without complaint
for she herself is time and the blaze in the sahara
for she herself is liberty and freedom is imagination


another draw as night did fall
and away she flung the world full of wrath


the world has inflicted a wound
but she herself is the world and holds life in her hands.
</pre>
